_**AIRBNB DATA ANALYSIS**_

**1. Data Collection:**
  Gather data from Airbnb's public API or other available sources. Collect information on listings, hosts, reviews, pricing, and location data.

**2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
  Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality. Convert data types, handle duplicates, and standardize formats.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and patterns in the data. Explore relationships between variables and identify potential insights.

**4. Visualization:**
  Create visualizations to represent key metrics and trends. Use charts, graphs, and maps to convey information effectively. Consider using tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualizations.

**5. Geospatial Analysis:**
  Utilize geospatial analysis to understand the geographical distribution of listings. Map out popular areas, analyze neighborhood characteristics, and visualize pricing variations.
